<h1>Virtual Envelopes</h1>
<p>Step 1- Create your envelopes and put money in them.</p>
<p>When you make a purchase, a receipt is placed in the envelope that the money came from.  You can keep your receipts for as long as you need them.  Delete them when you don't need them anymore.</p>
<p>Because your envelopes and the money inside of them are virtual you can make a purchase using any payment method you want.  You don't have to just use cash.</p>
<p>Step 2- Add whatever payment methods you frequently use for your purchases.</p>
<p>Step 3- Be sure to document your purchases to keep current balances in your envelopes.  You can add money to your envelopes anytime you want.</p>
